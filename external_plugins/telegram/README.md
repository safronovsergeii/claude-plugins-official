# Telegram

Connect a Telegram bot to your Claude Code with an MCP server.

The MCP server logs into Telegram as a bot and provides tools to Claude to reply, react, or edit messages. When you message the bot, the server forwards the message to your Claude Code session.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) — the MCP server runs on Bun. Install with `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.

## Quick Setup
> Default pairing flow for a single-user DM bot. See [ACCESS.md](./ACCESS.md) for groups and multi-user setups.

**1. Create a bot with BotFather.**

Open a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram and send `/newbot`. BotFather asks for two things:

- **Name** — the display name shown in chat headers (anything, can contain spaces)
- **Username** — a unique handle ending in `bot` (e.g. `my_assistant_bot`). This becomes your bot's link: `t.me/my_assistant_bot`.

BotFather replies with a token that looks like `123456789:AAHfiqksKZ8...` — that's the whole token, copy it including the leading number and colon.

**2. Install the plugin.**

These are Claude Code commands — run `claude` to start a session first.

Install the plugin:
```
/plugin install telegram@claude-plugins-official
```

**3. Give the server the token.**

```
/telegram:configure 123456789:AAHfiqksKZ8...
```

Writes `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...` to `.claude/channels/telegram/.env` in your project. You can also write that file by hand, or set the variable in your shell environment — shell takes precedence.

**4. Relaunch with the channel flag.**

The server won't connect without this — exit your session and start a new one:

```sh
claude --channels plugin:telegram@claude-plugins-official
```

**5. Pair.**

With Claude Code running from the previous step, DM your bot on Telegram — it replies with a 6-character pairing code. If the bot doesn't respond, make sure your session is running with `--channels`. In your Claude Code session:

```
/telegram:access pair <code>
```

Your next DM reaches the assistant.

> Unlike Discord, there's no server invite step — Telegram bots accept DMs immediately. Pairing handles the user-ID lookup so you never touch numeric IDs.

**6. Lock it down.**

Pairing is for capturing IDs. Once you're in, switch to `allowlist` so strangers don't get pairing-code replies. Ask Claude to do it, or `/telegram:access policy allowlist` directly.

## Access control

See **[ACCESS.md](./ACCESS.md)** for DM policies, groups, mention detection, delivery config, skill commands, and the `access.json` schema.

Quick reference: IDs are **numeric user IDs** (get yours from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)). Default policy is `pairing`. `ackReaction` only accepts Telegram's fixed emoji whitelist.

## Tools exposed to the assistant

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `reply` | Send to a chat. Takes `chat_id` + `text`, optionally `reply_to` (message ID) for native threading and `files` (absolute paths) for attachments. Images (`.jpg`/`.png`/`.gif`/`.webp`) send as photos with inline preview; other types send as documents. Max 50MB each. Auto-chunks text; files send as separate messages after the text. Returns the sent message ID(s). |
| `react` | Add an emoji reaction to a message by ID. **Only Telegram's fixed whitelist** is accepted (👍 👎 ❤ 🔥 👀 etc). |
| `edit_message` | Edit a message the bot previously sent. Useful for "working…" → result progress updates. Only works on the bot's own messages. |
| `fetch_messages` | Fetch recent messages from a chat. Returns oldest-first with message IDs. Telegram's Bot API has no server-side history — this returns messages buffered in memory since the bot started (up to 100 per chat). Includes both inbound and bot's own outbound messages. |
| `download_attachment` | Download attachments (documents, voice, video, audio, video notes) from a message by ID. Photos auto-download on arrival; use this for other file types. Returns local file paths ready to `Read`. |

Inbound messages trigger a typing indicator automatically — Telegram shows
"botname is typing…" while the assistant works on a response.

## Supported message types

| Type | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Text | Delivered directly |
| Photos | Auto-downloaded to `~/.claude/channels/telegram/inbox/`, path in `<channel>` tag — assistant can `Read` it. Telegram compresses photos; send as document (long-press → Send as File) for originals. |
| Documents | Metadata delivered (name/type/size). Assistant calls `download_attachment` to fetch on demand. |
| Voice messages | Metadata delivered. Download via `download_attachment`. |
| Video | Metadata delivered. Download via `download_attachment`. |
| Video notes (circles) | Metadata delivered. Download via `download_attachment`. |
| Audio | Metadata delivered. Download via `download_attachment`. |
| Stickers | Emoji + set name delivered as text. |

## Message history

Telegram's Bot API has no server-side message history endpoint. The bot
buffers messages in memory as they arrive (up to 100 per chat). Use
`fetch_messages` to retrieve them — both inbound messages and the bot's own
replies are included. The buffer resets when the bot restarts.

## Resilience

The bot includes several layers of error recovery:

- **Auto-reconnect** — if Telegram long polling crashes (network loss, API outage), the bot reconnects automatically with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 60s max). Backoff resets on successful reconnect.
- **API retry** — outbound API calls (reply, react, edit) automatically retry on rate limits (429), server errors (5xx), and network failures (ETIMEDOUT, ECONNRESET). Up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff.
- **Middleware error handler** — errors in message processing are logged, not crashed. The bot continues accepting messages.
- **Process safety nets** — uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections are logged instead of killing the process.
- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGTERM/SIGINT cleanly stop polling and clear resources.
- **Stale response detection** — if Claude hasn't replied within 30 seconds, the bot sends a "still working" message. At 90 seconds it warns that Claude may be waiting for permission approval in the terminal. Clears automatically when a reply is sent.
